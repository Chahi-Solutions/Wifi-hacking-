# Ethical Wi-Fi Hacking Guide

## 1. Basic Networking Knowledge
- **IP Addressing & MAC Addresses:** Understand how devices communicate and are identified in a network.
- **Protocols:** Familiarity with TCP/IP, UDP, and DHCP is essential to know how data flows in a network.
- **OSI Model:** Helps to understand network layers and where vulnerabilities may exist.

## 2. Wi-Fi Standards and Security Protocols
- **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):** Outdated and easily cracked.
- **WPA & WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access):** More secure, but still vulnerable to certain attacks, like the **KRACK** attack.
- **WPA3:** The newest, most secure protocol, but it's important to stay updated on potential vulnerabilities.

## 3. Encryption and Hashing
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):** Used in WPA2 and WPA3 for strong encryption.
- **Hashing Algorithms:** Understanding how Wi-Fi passwords are hashed and how they can be cracked (e.g., using brute-force attacks).

## 4. Common Attack Techniques
- **Deauthentication Attacks:** Disconnect devices to capture WPA handshakes when they reconnect.
- **Packet Sniffing:** Capture network traffic to look for unencrypted or weakly encrypted data.
- **Brute Force & Dictionary Attacks:** Use precomputed hashes or password lists to guess Wi-Fi passwords.
- **Evil Twin Attack:** Set up a fake access point to trick users into connecting to it.

## 5. Tools for Ethical Wi-Fi Hacking
- **Aircrack-ng:** Crack WEP and WPA-PSK encryption.
- **Wireshark:** Analyze network traffic to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Kismet:** Detect and analyze wireless networks.
- **Reaver:** Crack WPS PINs on WPA/WPA2 networks.

## 6. Legal and Ethical Considerations
- **Obtain Permission:** Always have explicit consent from the network owner.
- **Stay Within Scope:** Perform only the tasks agreed upon in your testing agreement.
- **Responsible Disclosure:** Report vulnerabilities responsibly and with respect for privacy.

## 7. Keep Learning
The Wi-Fi security landscape constantly evolves, so itâ€™s important to stay up-to-date with new vulnerabilities, tools, and attack methods to remain effective in ethical hacking.
